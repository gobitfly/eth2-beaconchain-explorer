  summary: Voluntary exits for a slot
  description: >-
    Retrieve all voluntary exit operations included in the beacon block for a
    specific slot. A voluntary exit is a signed message from a validator
    indicating the epoch at which they choose to exit the active set.

    recently processed slot. The response lists each voluntary exit along with
    block inclusion metadata.
