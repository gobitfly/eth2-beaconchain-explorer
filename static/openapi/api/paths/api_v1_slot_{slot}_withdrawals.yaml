  summary: Withdrawals for a slot
  description: >-
    Retrieve all withdrawal operations included in the execution payload of the
    beacon block for a specific slot. A withdrawal moves ETH from the beacon
    chain to an execution-layer address after a validator has eligible balance.

    Provide a slot number or use the keyword `latest` to fetch from the most
    recently processed slot. The response lists each withdrawal with the
    recipient address, amount in gwei, the originating validator index, and the
    global withdrawal index.
