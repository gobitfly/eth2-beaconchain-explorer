  summary: Sync committee for a period
  description: >-
    Retrieve the sync committee membership for a given sync period. The sync
    committee contains 512 validator indices that participate in light-client
    finality via sync committee signatures. The validators in the response are
    ordered by the sync-committee index (the position used when interpreting
    syncaggregate_bits in blocks).

    A sync period spans 256 consecutive epochs. Sync committees were introduced
    with the Altair upgrade. Requests for periods before Altair return an error
    because no sync committee exists for those periods. On Ethereum mainnet,
    Altair activated at epoch 74240 (period 290).
