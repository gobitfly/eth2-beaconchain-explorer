description: >-
  Attestation inclusion effectiveness for a validator expressed as a normalized score.
  The score is computed from the underlying inclusion percentage as:
  score = 1 + (1 − percentage/100) = 2 − percentage/100.
  A score of 1.0 indicates perfect effectiveness (100% inclusion in the most
  recently completed epoch); a score approaching 2.0 indicates poor effectiveness
  (0% inclusion).
