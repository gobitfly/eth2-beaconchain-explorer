description: >-
  Sync committee membership for a single sync period. Includes the period index,
  the start and end epochs, and the 512 validator indices ordered by
  sync-committee index. The ordering matches the bit positions in
  `syncaggregate_bits` found in blocks.
properties:
  period:
    type: integer
    description: Sync period index (>= 0). Each period spans 256 consecutive epochs.
    minimum: 0
    example: 500
  start_epoch:
    type: integer
    description: Epoch at which the sync period begins. On Ethereum mainnet this equals `period * 256`.
    minimum: 0
    example: 128000
  end_epoch:
    type: integer
    description: Epoch at which the sync period ends (inclusive). On Ethereum mainnet this equals `start_epoch + 255`.
    minimum: 0
    example: 128255
  validators:
    type: array
    description: >-
      List of validator indices that form the sync committee for this period,
      ordered by sync-committee index (length 512 as per the consensus spec).
    items:
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
    minItems: 512
    maxItems: 512
    example:
      - 383220
